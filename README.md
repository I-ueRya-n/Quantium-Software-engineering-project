# Quantium starter repo

Provided with a raw CSV file. I had to process \& clean the data and finally visualize using Dash Framework.
<br>
The project contains three main scripts:
- FormatScript.py - Its function is to merge & process the data in ./data file and write them into Formatted_data.csv.
- app.py - Using Dash Framework, I implemented a script to visualize the data by data, sales and region.
- tests.py - To test the functionality of the app.

<br>

## Installation
Clone the repo and install dependencies with python package manger pip.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/3laaHisham/quantium-starter-repo.git
cd quantium-starter-repo/
pip install -r  requirements.txt
```

<br>

## Usage
1. *You Can Run Formatscript.Py To Process The Data But It Is Already Processed So You Can Directly Go To The Next Step.*

2. Run the following command.

```bash
python app.py
```

3. FInally, open this [http://127.0.0.1:8050/](http://127.0.0.1:8050/) on any browser you like.

We look forward to hear your feedback.
